# Online Course

Online Course is a multi-page website that uses many different plugins of mine and not so much of mine. Made for my portfolio.

The site is really big, it took about two weeks to create.

> ⚠ Attention ⚠ <br>
I am aware of the site "https://createx.createx.studio/online-courses/", but apparently, it has not been used for a long time. <br>
I found the design on the Internet in open access (https://www.figma.com/file/2ZWX21Kfd6rLZVAm7hO8lz/Free-%231.-Online-course?node-id=0%3A1).
Createx themselves have changed the logo and have a different website/sites.
This project was created solely for the purpose of demonstrating my skills, but if you have any complaints, please let me know by email.
